# Hardlinking Guide

Hardlinking should more or less be in place if you have followed the saltbox setup guide.

In short, if your container path mappings match your system mappings match your other container mappings then hardlinking should work fine within your arrs as long as your downloads path is on the same disk as your local media path.

A more comprehensive guide will be added soon.
