    Just fill out the username and password you want to use, confirm the password and click on the “Create Admin” button.

    That’s it! You should now be able to browse and listen to all your music.

    !!! Note
             It usually take a couple of minutes for your music to start appearing in Navidrome’s UI. <br />
             You can check the logs to see what is the scan progress. If you have a large library this may take some time.
