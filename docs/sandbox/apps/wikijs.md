# Wikijs

## What is it?

[Wikijs](https://js.wiki/) is a modern, lightweight and powerful wiki app built on NodeJS.

- Manage all aspects of your wiki using the extensive and intuitive admin area.
- Fully customize the appearance of your wiki, including a light and dark mode.
- Make your wiki public, completely private or a mix of both.

!!!info
    By default, the role is protected behind your Authelia/SSO middleware. You will also have to log into Wikijs with the email and password you set up upon instalation.
