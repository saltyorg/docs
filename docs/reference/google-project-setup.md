This guide will show you how to set up a Google Project and create credentials that will work for safire.

It's assuming you're working through the steps from [here](rclone-manual.md).

This guide is assuming you are using a standard GSuite Business or GSuite Workspace account.

1. Open Google APIs Console site: https://console.developers.google.com and login with your Google account.

    Click on the project or organization at the top:

6. Search for "Admin". Click "Admin SDK API".

    Click the button to enable the API:

    You'll go to a API Overview page.  Click the browser back button twice:

    ![](../images/gdrive-project/10-admin-enabled.png)

    Repeat this process for six more APIs:
    
        - Google Drive API
        - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API
        - Cloud Resource Manager API
        - Service Usage API
        - Service Management API
        - Google Sheets API

    You may find that some of these APIs have been enabled already as dependencies of others, like Service Management here:

    In that case, click the website back arrow once and move on to the next one.
