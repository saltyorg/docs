# Karakeep

[Karakeep](https://karakeep.app/) is an open source "Bookmark Everything" app that uses AI for automatically tagging the content you throw at it. The app is built with self-hosting as a first class citizen.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.
