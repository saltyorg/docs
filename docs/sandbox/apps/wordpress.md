### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install sandbox-wordpress

```

### 2. URL

- To access WordPress , visit `https://wordpress._yourdomain.com_`

### 3. Setup

- No default user is configured until you run through the setup screen, so you should ideally run through setup as soon as wordpress is deployed to secure the site.
