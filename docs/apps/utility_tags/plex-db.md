# Plex DB

## What is it?

`plex-db` runs some database maintenance tasks on the plex databases for each of your defined plex instances:

1. Check if main database passes integrity_check
1. Check if blobs database passes integrity_check
1. Back up databases
1. does a sqlite 'VACUUM' operation on the main database
1. does a sqlite 'VACUUM' operation on the blobs database
1. does a sqlite 'REINDEX' operation on the main database
1. does a sqlite 'REINDEX' operation on the blobs database

If any of those operations fail, the backup databases are restored.

The plex containers are stopped for the duration of this process.

### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install plex-db

```
