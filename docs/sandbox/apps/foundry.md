# Foundry

## What is it?

[Foundry](https://foundryvtt.com/) is a modern, feature-rich "virtual tabletop" (a "VTT"). Foundry VTT serves as a digital "tabletop" so that you can gather your friends and party members and have an excellent role-playing game experience together digitally.

Foundry VTT provides the full set of digital tools necessary to emulate and (and often surpass!) the experience of playing a game in-person, such as battle maps, integrated character sheets, digital dice, audio, voice / video, and more.

While other VTTs can provide some of these basic elements, the Foundry team prides ourselves on continually pushing the boundaries of the possible, providing rich dynamic lighting/fog of war, immersive audio, interactive map regions, powerful modding capabilities, and much more. Foundry VTT gives you everything you need (and then some) to forge thrilling and memorable moments with your gaming group!
