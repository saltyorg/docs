# MC Router

## THIS DOCUMENTATION IS NOT YET COMPLETED

## What is it?

[MC Router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) Routes Minecraft client connections to backend servers based upon the requested server address.

!!! note
    MC Router is not intended to be used as a standalone server, but rather as a component of a larger Minecraft server network. It is installed in tandem with the [Minecraft](../apps/minecraft.md) role.
