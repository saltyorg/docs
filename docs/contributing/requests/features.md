# Suggesting a Feature

We welcome suggestions for genuine enhancements to Saltbox, Sandbox, or our documentation. Please submit requests that add real value, not workarounds for issues already addressed or support questions.

## How to Submit

- Open a new issue in the relevant repository:
    - [Saltbox](https://github.com/saltyorg/Saltbox/issues)
    - [Sandbox](https://github.com/saltyorg/Sandbox/issues) (app requests)
    - [sb-go](https://github.com/saltyorg/sb-go/issues) (Saltbox command-line)
    - [docs](https://github.com/saltyorg/docs/issues)
- Use the "Feature Request" template.
- Clearly describe your proposed feature, its benefits, and why it is needed.
- Include relevant context, examples, or use cases.

## Guidelines

- Ensure your request is a genuine enhancement, not a workaround for a misunderstood problem.
- If your idea is actually a solution to a support issue, please use our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ugfKXpFND8) for support instead.
- Check existing requests to avoid duplicates.
- Be specific about the problem your feature solves.
- Suggest possible implementation details if you have them.

## What Happens Next?

- The team will review your request.
- Discussion and feedback may follow.
- Accepted requests will be added to the roadmap.
