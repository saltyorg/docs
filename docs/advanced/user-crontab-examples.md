# Note that this is just some examples, not a list of things that any particular user should have in their crontab

Nothing in here is a specific recommendation.  DO NOT copy and paste this with the idea that saltbox team is sugeesting that you *should* do all these things.  They may not work as shown here, depending on your setup.

It's just a catalog of examples to demonstrate how one might set this sort of thing up.

To edit your crontab, enter `crontab -e`

```bash
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
@daily cd /opt/plex-meta-manager && python plex-meta-manager.py -r
0 7 * * 7 sudo PATH='/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin' env ANSIBLE_CONFIG='/srv/git/saltbox/ansible.cfg' 'sb install backup' -v  >> '/home/seed/logs/saltbox_backup.log' 2>&1
* * * * * /opt/scripts/nzbget/cleanup.sh
0 10 * * * /opt/scripts/plex/optimize.sh
0 * * * * PATH='/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin' cd /opt/SonarrSync/ ; /usr/bin/python SonarrSync.py
```

**Line 1** `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin` sets the PATH environment variable. - Allows using `sb` commands in cronjobs. e.g `sb update`

**Line 2:** `plex-meta-manager` script to make Plex collections. - [Runs midnight daily **server time**]

**Line 3:** Saltbox backup. - [Runs every Sunday @ 7AM **server time**]

**Line 4:** Update Saltbox and do auto-updates - [Runs daily]  NOTE: Doing this in an unattended context carries risk. If an error occurs during the process, it could leave all the containers shut down.

**Line 5:** cleanup script to remove left over junk in /downloads/nzbs/nzbget/completed/sonarr/* etc. - [Runs every minute] `Note: Scroll down for a couple ideas for this script.`

**Line 6:** Script to optimize the Plex database. - [Runs daily @ 10AM **server time**]
`Note: Scroll down for script.`

**Line 7:** [Enormoz's SonarrSync](https://github.com/EnorMOZ/SonarrSync) (based on Sperryfreak's RadarrSync) - [Runs hourly]

Note that this script is specific to its author's setup when it was written.  It probably won't work for you as-is.  You'll need to edit the paths to match your situation.
