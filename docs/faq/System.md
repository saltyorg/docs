1. Choose an X86 server (vs ARM).

2. Select "Ubuntu Xenial" as the distribution.

3. Click the server on the list.

4. Under "ADVANCED OPTIONS", click "SHOW".

5. Set "ENABLE LOCAL BOOT" to `off`.

## If you are using an OVH server...

If you are having issues upgrading the kernel on ovh, where the kernel upgrade is not taking effect..

 `uname -r` to see if you have `grs` in kernel version string...

 if so, see https://pterodactyl.io/daemon/0.6/kernel_modifications.html on how to update the kernel.



## Find your User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID)

Use the following commands to find out your account's user name and group info:

```
id
```
or

```
id `whoami`
```
You'll see a line like the following:

```
uid=XXXX(yourusername) gid=XXXX(yourgroup) groups=XXXX(yourgroup)
```

## How to create a user account

- Run the following commands line by line:

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m <username>
   sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
   sudo passwd <username>
   sudo chsh -s /bin/bash <username>
   su <username>
   ```


## Change shell of user account to bash

How to check current shell:

```shell
echo $0
-sh
```

or

```shell
echo ${SHELL}
/bin/sh
```

Run this command to set bash as your shell (where `<user>` is replaced with your username):

```
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash <user>
sudo reboot
```

## How to fix permission issues


 /opt folder

1. Stop all docker containers

   ```
   docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
   ```

2. Change ownership of /opt. Replace `user` and `group` to match yours' (see [here](FAQfind-your-user-id-uid-and-group-id-gid)).

   ```
   sudo chown -R user:group /opt
   ```

3. Change permission inheritance of /opt.

   ```
   sudo chmod -R ugo+X /opt
   ```

4. Start all docker containers

   ```
   docker start $(docker ps -a -q)
   ```


 /mnt folder


1. Run the `mounts` tag

   ```
   sb install mounts
   ```
