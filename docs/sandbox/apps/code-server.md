## Migration from the old `coder` role

The old `coder` role was renamed to `code-server` on Dec 19th 2022.
In order to migrate to the new role, if you aren't using a custom folder for `coder`, rename the inventory variables if you have any, then run:

``` shell

sb install sandbox-code-server -e 'code_server_migrate_coder=true'

```

The `coder` role is currently deprecated and won't receive any updates, so please run the migration to the new role as soon as possible.
