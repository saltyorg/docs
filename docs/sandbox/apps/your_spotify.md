# Yourspotify

## What is it?

[Yourspotify](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify) is a self-hosted application that tracks what you listen and offers you a dashboard to explore statistics about it! It's composed of a web server which polls the Spotify API every now and then and a web application on which you can explore your statistics.

Note that while the documentation linked here is for the original project, the Docker image linked below is a fork of the original project. Particularly the [linuxserver/your_spotify](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-your_spotify) image.
