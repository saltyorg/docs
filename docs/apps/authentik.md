# Authentik

## What is it?

[Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) is an IdP (Identity Provider) and SSO (single sign on) that is built with security at the forefront of every piece of code, every feature, with an emphasis on flexibility and versatility. It supports all of the major providers, such as OAuth2, SAML, LDAP, and SCIM, so you can pick the protocol that you need for each application.

### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install authentik

```

### 2. URL

- To access Authentik, visit `https://auth._yourdomain.com_`

### 3. Setup

!!! info

    ``` yaml title="Default Login"

        user: saltbox_user # (1)!
        password: saltbox_password # (2)!

    ```

    1. Replace `saltbox_user` with the username you set when installing Saltbox.
    2. Replace `saltbox_password` with the password you set when installing Saltbox.

To enable Authentik with a single container, or on a per role basis, set the following [inventory](../saltbox/inventory/index.md) entry:

``` yaml title="Authentik Single Container Toggle"

radarr_traefik_sso_middleware: "authentik@docker"

```

To enable Authentik globally, set the following [inventory](../saltbox/inventory/index.md) entry:

``` yaml title="Authentik Global Toggle"

traefik_default_sso_middleware: "authentik@docker"

```

You would use one or the other, the global toggle will install Authentik together with Traefik when it is being installed, the role toggle requires manually installing Authentik. Traefik needs to be reinstalled at least once after updating to deploy the Authentik middleware to enable use of it. If you are using the global toggle, you will need to reinstall all of the other roles you use to enable Authentik.

To set up Authentik similarly to how we have [Authelia](../apps/authelia.md) set up, follow these steps:

After logging in, you will be greeted with the dashboard. Click on the `Admin Interface` button in the top right corner.

Click on the `Flows and Stages` drop down and select `Stages`.

Locate the `default-authentication-login` stage and click the `Edit` button. (Far right)

- Below you will see the default User Login Stage info.

    ![Defaults](../images/authentik/authentik-user-auth-default-screenshot.png)

You can change these values to anything you want, but for this example, we will change the `Session Duration` to `minutes=30` and the `Stay Signed in Offset` to `weeks=2`.

- Below you will see the updated User Login Stage info.

### 4. Additional Settings

To enable email notifications, set these [inventory](../saltbox/inventory/index.md) entries to your desired values:

``` yaml title="Authentik Email Settings"

authentik_email_host: "localhost" # (1)!
authentik_email_port: "25" # (2)!
authentik_email_username: "" # (3)!
authentik_email_password: "" # (4)!
authentik_email_tls: "false"
authentik_email_ssl: "false"
authentik_email_timeout: "10" # (5)!
authentik_email_from: "authentik@localhost" # (6)!

```

1. Replace `localhost` with your email host. IE: `smtp-relay.gmail.com`
2. Replace `25` with your email port. IE: `587`
3. Replace `""` with your email username if necessary.
4. Replace `""` with your email password if necessary.
5. Replace `10` with your email timeout in seconds.
6. Replace `authentik@localhost` with your email from email address. IE: `Authentik <noreply@your_domain.com>`

Redeploy the Authentik role to apply these changes.

### 5. IDP/OIDC Configuration

To configure Authentik as an IDP (Identity Provider) or OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider, follow these steps:

Click on the `Admin Interface` button in the top right corner.

Locate the `Applications` tab on the left panel and click on it.

Near the center of the screen select the blue `Create With Wizard` button.

- Below you will see the `Create Application` screen.

    ![Create Application](../images/authentik/authentik-create-application-screenshot.png)

On the next screen select the `Oauth2/OIDC` option. (This will be the first option)

In this example, on the `Configure OAuth2/OpenId Provider` screen, only the required fields will be filled.

- Below you will see the `Configure OAuth2` screen.

    ![Configure Oauth2](../images/authentik/authentik-configure-oauth2.png)

Under the `Protocol Settings` section, fill in the following fields:

- `Client ID`: `immich` (This can be anything you want, and is auto filled in. You can change it if you want)
- `Client Secret`: Its probably best to leave this as is, but you can change it if you want.
- `Redirect URI/Origins`:
  - `https://immich.your_domain.com/auth/login`
  - `https://immich.your_domain.com/user-settings`
  - `app.immich:/`

#### OIDC Configuration Example

In the screenshot below, you can see how the [Immich](../sandbox/apps/immich.md) application is configured to use Authentik as an OIDC provider.

![Authentik Oauth Example](../images/authentik/authentik-oauth-example.png)

The only other field you need to concern yourself with is the `Mobile Redirect URI`, which is `https://immich.your_domain.com/api/oauth/mobile-redirect`.
