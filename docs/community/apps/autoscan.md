# Autoscan

## What is it?

[Autoscan](https://github.com/Cloudbox/autoscan){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } replaces the default Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin behaviour for picking up file changes on the file system. Autoscan integrates with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr and Google Share Drives to fetch changes in near real-time without relying on the file system.

Autoscan is a rewrite of the original Plex Autoscan written in the Go language. In addition, this rewrite introduces a more modular approach and should be easy to extend in the future.

### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install cm-autoscan

```

### 2. Setup

The Saltbox Community Autoscan role will attempt to partially configure your autoscan config file located at `/opt/autoscan/config.yml`. You should refer to the documentation and adjust this file as suits your own needs. The config generated is very minimal. If you wish to monitor sharedrive activity you should probably consider using [a-train](https://github.com/m-rots/a-train/pkgs/container/a-train){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } rather than soon to be shelved bernard trigger.
