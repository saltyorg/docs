# Multiple App Instances

Apps that used to be supported by the "ArrX" system which allowed the user to define a set of instances of a given app [as opposed to installing multiple instances one at a time] are being transitioned to a new generalized, inventory-driven approach.

The general idea is to move all the configuration into the `/srv/git/saltbox/inventories/host_vars/localhost.yml` along with [other customizations](../saltbox/inventory/index.md).

Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr support this new method as of this writing.

### Overview

Define a list of all the instances of the all you want to create; if you don't want to customize them beyond that, this is all that's required.

The standard app tag will now set up all those instances.

For example, a SonarrX config might have looked like this:

```yaml
sonarrx:
  roles:
    - ""
    - bing
    - bang
    - boing
```

That would be set up in `settings.yml`.

With this new method, that will be replaced with this in `localhost.yml`:

``` yaml
sonarr_instances: ["sonarr", "sonarrbing", "sonarrbang", "sonarrboing"]
```

Note a primary changepoint is that the **entire name of the instance** is specified.  The role will no longer prepend the name of the app.

Given the config above, `sb install sonarr` would install:

| entry         | Container    | Config dir         | Subdomain                    |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| sonarr        | sonarr       | `/opt/sonarr`      | sonarr.YOURDOMAIN.TLD        |
| sonarrbing    | sonarrbing   | `/opt/sonarrbing`  | sonarrbing.YOURDOMAIN.TLD    |
| sonarrbang    | sonarrbang   | `/opt/sonarrbang`  | sonarrbang.YOURDOMAIN.TLD    |
| sonarrboing   | sonarrboing  | `/opt/sonarrboing` | sonarrboing.YOURDOMAIN.TLD   |


Those names have to be unique across all of your containers, so it is suggested that you keep with the `rolename+suffix` pattern for these additional instances.

### Per-instance customization

Any instance defined can edit the following set of variables on a per instance basis in `localhost.yml`:

!!! note
    Replacing "instance" with the actual **instance name**, of course, i.e. sonarrbing_web_subdomain, etc.
```
instance_web_subdomain
instance_web_domain
instance_web_port
instance_traefik_sso_middleware
instance_docker_image_repo
instance_docker_image_tag
instance_docker_ports_defaults
instance_docker_ports_ui
instance_docker_ports_custom
instance_themepark_enabled
instance_themepark_domain
instance_themepark_theme
instance_docker_envs_default
instance_docker_envs_custom
instance_docker_commands_default
instance_docker_docker_commands_custom
instance_docker_volumes_default
instance_docker_volumes_custom
instance_docker_volumes_theme
instance_docker_devices_default
instance_docker_devices_custom
instance_docker_hosts_default
instance_docker_hosts_custom
instance_docker_labels_default
instance_docker_labels_custom
instance_docker_networks_default
instance_docker_networks_custom
instance_docker_capabilities_default

```
