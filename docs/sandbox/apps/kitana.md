# Kitana

## What is it?

[Kitana](https://github.com/pannal/Kitana) is a responsive Plex plugin web frontend.

Running one instance of Kitana can serve infinite amounts of servers and plugins - you can even expose your Kitana instance to your friends, so they can manage their plugins as well, so they don't have to run their own Kitana instance.

Kitana was built for Sub-Zero originally, but handles other plugins just as well.
