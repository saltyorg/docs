# Elasticsearch

## What is it?

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) is an open source distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning-fast search, fine‑tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

!!! info
    Elasticsearch is typically not a standalone app, it is run in tandem with another role to enable features.
