Suitable install type: Feederbox

### 1. Installation

``` shell
sb install sandbox-omegabrr
```

### 2. Setup

The configuration file `/opt/omegabrr/config.yaml` will be pre-filled with your new API token and your Radarr and Sonarr details, but missing an autobrr API key which you must provide.

Add your filter IDs (inside the bracketsâ€“comma separated) to their corresponding *arr instance:
```yaml
      filters: [9,10,99,100]
```
Restart the Docker container for the changes to take effect.

### 3. URL

By default, the built-in HTTP server is not exposed to the web and can be queried locally via `http://omegabrr:7441`. If you wish to enable external access, add the following to your Saltbox inventory and redeploy the role:

```yaml
omegabrr_web_enabled: true
```
It will then be available at `https://omegabrr.domain.tld`.

### 4. Usage

Use the URL with the API token to trigger filter refreshes via webhook: [Service](https://github.com/autobrr/omegabrr#service){: .header-icons target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" }
