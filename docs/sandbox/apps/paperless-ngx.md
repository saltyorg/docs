# Paperless NGX

## What is it?

[Paperless NGX](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#paperless-ngx){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } is a simple Django application running in two parts: a Consumer (the thing that does the indexing) and the Web server (the part that lets you search & download already-indexed documents).

Paperless-NGX is forked from paperless-ng to continue the great work and distribute responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people.
