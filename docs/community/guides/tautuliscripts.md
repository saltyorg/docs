# Introduction
This is a quick guide to installing and configuring a Tautulli custom script. It will teach you how to download and configure a Tautulli (plexpy) custom script that drops Plex video streams transcoding from a 4K source.

## Install the script
Access your Saltbox server as your normal non-root user.

We'll be installing the [Killstream.py script](https://github.com/blacktwin/JBOPS/tree/master/killstream){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } from the [JBOPS](https://github.com/blacktwin/JBOPS){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } script collection.

### Download the script using curl:
```
cd /opt/scripts/plexpy/
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blacktwin/JBOPS/master/killstream/kill_stream.py
sudo chown seed:seed kill_stream.py
chmod a+x kill_stream.py
```

### Verify that the script was downloaded successfully with:
```
ls -la kill_stream.py
```

The file should be around 9700 bytes in size.

## Configure Tautulli Notification Agent
Enter Tautulli settings and find the **Notification Agents** link on the left side menu.\
Click **Add a new notification agent** and scroll down to **Script** in the selection dialog.

#### Configuration panel
Enter `/scripts/plexpy/` in the script folder and exit the text input field.

Select the script named `./kill_stream.py` in the Script File drop-down.\
_Check your previous steps or bug someone on discord if the script is not listed._

Enter `Terminate 4K transcodes` or something of your own choice in the description field.

#### Triggers panel

Put a checkmark in `Playback Start` and `Transcode Decision Change`

#### Notifications Conditions panel

Condition {1}: `Video Decision` - `is` - `transcode`

Condition {2}: `Library Name` - `contains` - `4K`

Note: adjust the library name if your 4K libraries does not contain the name **4K**.

#### Arguments panel

Under Playback Start enter the following:
```
--jbop stream --username {username} --sessionId {session_id} --killMessage 'Transcoding is not allowed from the 4K libraries.'
```
Under Transcode Decision Change enter the following:
```
--jbop stream --username {username} --sessionId {session_id} --killMessage 'Transcoding is not allowed from the 4K libraries.'
```

### Finishing up
Click the **Save** button to save the new notification agent.

You can test the agent by attempting to play a 4K movie through the Plex web app and downgrade the quality to 2Mbit. It will be transcoding for about 5-10 seconds, after which you should get the stream kill message.

There is a list of when a notification agent is triggered in the **Notification logs** section of Tautulli logs.
