# Readarr

## What is it?

[Readarr](http://readarr.com/){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } is an ebook and audiobook collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books from your favourite authors and will grab, sort and rename them.

Note that only one type of a given book is supported. <br />
**If you want both an audiobook and ebook of a given book you will need multiple instances.**

!!! NOTE
      Readarr is currently in beta testing and is generally still in a work in progress. Features may be broken, incomplete, or cause spontaneous combustion.
