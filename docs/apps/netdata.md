# Netdata

## What is it?

[Netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/) is distributed, real-time, performance and health monitoring for systems and applications.

Netdata provides insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the systems it runs (including web servers, databases, applications), using highly interactive web dashboards. It can run autonomously, without any third party components, or it can be integrated to existing monitoring toolchains (Prometheus, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Kafka, Grafana, etc).

Netdata is designed to permanently run on all systems (physical & virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their core function.

Netdata is free, open-source software.
