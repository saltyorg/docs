## 1. Accessing NZBGet

- To access NZBGet, visit `https://nzbget._yourdomain.com_`

## 2. Settings

### Paths

- Download paths have already been specified, no need to change those.

### News-Servers

- Add your [news servers](../reference/usenet-torrent.md).

### Security

- Login settings are preset out of the box (`user` / `passwd` as set in [accounts.yml](../reference/accounts.md)).

### Download Queue

- Disk Space

    - By default, minimum disk space is set at _100000_ (i.e. 100GB). When space goes lower than this, NZBGet will pause the queue. If you have a smaller hard drive, you will need to lower this setting.

### Connection

- DailyQuota

    - If you set up the 300 [service accounts in Rclone](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/rclone-manual/) you can ignore this.
    - Otherwise it's recommended you set this to `750000` (i.e. 750GB), to coincide with the Google Drive daily upload limit.

## 3. Extensions

- Location on server: `/opt/scripts/nzbget`.

- Location within NZBGet: `/scripts/nzbget`.
