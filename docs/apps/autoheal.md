# Autoheal

## What is it?

[Autoheal](https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal) monitors and restarts unhealthy Docker containers. It watches for containers that have a `HEALTHCHECK` defined and automatically restarts them when they become unhealthy, helping maintain service availability without manual intervention.

### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install autoheal

```

### 2. Setup

Autoheal works automatically by monitoring Docker containers with health checks. All Saltbox-deployed containers are configured with the appropriate `autoheal` label, so no additional configuration is required after installation.

You can view Autoheal's activity in the container logs:

``` shell
docker logs autoheal
```
