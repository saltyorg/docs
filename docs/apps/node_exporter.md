# Node Exporter

## What is it?

Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics. It exposes system-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network statistics, and more, which can be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.

### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install node_exporter

```

### 2. Setup

Node Exporter is installed directly on the host at `/opt/node_exporter/node_exporter` and runs as a systemd service. It exposes system metrics on port 9100 for Prometheus to scrape. Manage with `systemctl status/restart node_exporter`.

Note: Metrics are not password-protected by default. Consider firewall rules if exposing port 9100 externally.
