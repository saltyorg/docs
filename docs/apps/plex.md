!!! Settings

    === "Library"

        1. Click the Settings icon (top right) &rightarrow; "Server" (top) &rightarrow; "Library" (left).  Click "SHOW ADVANCED" in the upper right.

        2. Set the following:

            - "Empty trash automatically after every scan": `enabled`

                - THIS IS A CHANGE FROM WHEN _Plex Autoscan_ WAS THE DEFAULT

                - Autoscan is now the default scan app, and it does not empty trash

            - "Allow media deletion": `enabled`

            - "Generate video preview thumbnails": `never`

            - "Generate intro video markers": `never`

            - "Generate chapter thumbnails": `never`

            - "Analyze audio tracks for loudness": `never`

            - "Analyze audio tracks for sonic features": `never`

                > The reasoning behind disabling these things is mostly related to Google Drive API usage, data transfer, and disk space.  Accessing large portions of a given video file to generate thumbnails *may* generate large numbers of Google Drive API calls, and large amounts of data transfer.  Either of these things *may* result in your account suffering one of the various types of 24-hour bans Google hands out, which *may* prevent your server from playing media at all.  Also, storing these images *will* greatly inflate the size of `/opt/plex`, which can affect the speed of backups, your ability to download, and anything else related to disk space usage.  These are generally considered Bad Things, so the recommendation is to avoid the possibility by turning these options off.

## Add Media Libraries

In this section, we will add two libraries: one for Movies and one for TV.

_Note: If you would like to have custom Plex libraries (more than just a Movies and TV one), see [Customizing Plex Libraries](../reference/customizing-plex-libs.md)._

!!! Libraries

## Scan Media libraries

As mentioned in the [Introduction](../saltbox/basics/basics.md) page, [Autoscan](../apps/autoscan.md) will automatically scan the media files into Plex as they are downloaded, but this will require the Plex database to not be completely empty. So for every new library that is added, a one-time, manual scan is required.

To do so:

1. Click the 3 dots next to a Plex library.

2. Select "Scan Library Files".

   ![](../images/plex-media-server/plex-24-scan-library.png)

3. Repeat steps 1-2 for each library.

## Webtools

Webtools for Plex comes preinstalled. If you wish to setup Webtools and install 3rd party add-ons, you can go to `https://plex-webtools._yourdomain.com_` and log in with your Plex account.
