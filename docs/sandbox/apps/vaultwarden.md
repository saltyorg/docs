# vaultwarden

## What is it?

[vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } is an alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with upstream Bitwarden clients*, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.

!!! Note
      ðŸ“¢ This project was known as Bitwarden_RS and has been renamed to separate itself from the official Bitwarden server in the hopes of avoiding confusion and trademark/branding issues.
