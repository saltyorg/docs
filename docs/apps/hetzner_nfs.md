# Hetzner NFS VLAN

## What is it?

Connect 2+ servers hosted on Hetzner using NFS and VLAN.

_Note 1: This comes with no support other than the instructions provided here._

_Note 2: This setup has been tested to work with standard Unionfs/Rclone VFS setup. Using either MergerFS or any non-standard setup will require you to tweak the appropriate mounts. You can look at the roles to see what changes need to be done._

## 1. Installation

In this example, we'll set our Feederbox as the NFS server and our Mediabox as the NFS client - this is so that the feeder data can be available to the media server.

There are 3 phases to the setup. They are broken down below.

### Hetzner Robot

1. Log into [Hetzner Robot](https://robot.your-server.de/).

1. Create a VLAN (_vSwitch_) and add servers to it. Note the VLAN ID.

1. Setup Firewall.

      - Feederbox:

### NFS Server (Feederbox)

1. Setup the Ansible role config.

   1. Add `vlan_id`.

   2. `mount_client` setting is ignored for the NFS server (i.e. it will just use `2`).

      ``` { .shell }
      nano /srv/git/saltbox/hetzner_nfs.yml
      ```

      ``` { .yaml }
      hetzner_nfs:
        vlan_id: 4001
        mount_client: 3
      ```

1. Run Ansible role to configure the NFS server.

    ``` { .shell }

    sb install hetzner-nfs-server

    ```

### NFS Client (Mediabox)

1. Setup the Ansible role config.

   1. Add `vlan_id`.

   2. Add `mount_client`.

      Note: `mount_client` will need to be either `3` or a number > `250`.

      ``` { .shell }
      nano /srv/git/saltbox/hetzner_nfs.yml
      ```

      ``` { .yaml }
      hetzner_nfs:
        vlan_id: 4001
        mount_client: 3
      ```

2. Run Ansible role to configure the NFS client.

    ``` { .shell }

    sb install hetzner-nfs-client-mount

    ```

## Uninstall

Simply run the following commands on their respective servers:

### Uninstall NFS Server (Feederbox)

```shell
sb install hetzner-nfs-server-uninstall
```

### Uninstall NFS Client (Mediabox)

```shell
sb install hetzner-nfs-client-unmount
```
