## Automated rclone setup

There were initially plans for Saltbox to have an automated rclone setup for Google Drive.

Changes to Google's "unlimited" offering have back-burnered this effort indefinitely.

If you want to set up Saltbox using Google Drive, please follow the [partially scripted version of this process](rclone-manual.md).
