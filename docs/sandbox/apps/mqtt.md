# MQTT

## What is it?

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) is a lightweight messaging protocol that is designed for use in constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It is commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications for efficient and reliable communication between devices.

Also, MQTT does not have a web interface, so you will need to use a client to interact with it.
