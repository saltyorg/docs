# Plex Autoscan Extras

Other options for [Plex Autoscan](https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan).

## Google Drive Monitoring

!!! warning

    Plex Autoscan's Drive monitoring functionality no longer works for users that did not set it up prior to 28th of February. Google deprecated the authentication method used.

In addition to Plex Autoscan receiving scan requests from Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr, it can also monitor Google Drive directly for updates. When a new file is detected, it is checked against the Plex database and if this file is missing, a new scan request is sent to Plex.

Note: For details on setting up Teamdrives and/or Rclone-crypted remotes, visit [https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan](https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan).

If you used the [scripted rclone method](rclone-manual.md), there is a [script in the sb_gd repo](plex-autoscan-config.md) that will help with this setup.

To set this up:

1. Edit the config file:

    ```shell
    nano /opt/plex_autoscan/config/config.json
    ```

2. Under the `GOOGLE` section of the config, enable Google Drive monitoring and fill in your [Google Drive API Client ID and Secret](google-project-setup.md) [Step 15 of that process].

    ```json
    "ENABLED": true,
    "CLIENT_ID": "yourclientid",
    "CLIENT_SECRET": "yourclientsecret",
    ```

3. So that the entire section now looks like this (any order is fine):

    ```json
    "GOOGLE": {
      "ENABLED": true,
      "CLIENT_ID": "abcdefgh",
      "CLIENT_SECRET": "1234567",
      "ALLOWED": {
        "FILE_PATHS": [
          "My Drive/Media/Movies",
          "My Drive/Media/TV",
          "My Drive/Media/Music"
        ],
        "FILE_EXTENSIONS": true,
        "FILE_EXTENSIONS_LIST": [
          "webm","mkv","flv","vob","ogv","ogg","drc","gif",
          "gifv","mng","avi","mov","qt","wmv","yuv","rm",
          "rmvb","asf","amv","mp4","m4p","m4v","mpg","mp2",
          "mpeg","mpe","mpv","m2v","m4v","svi","3gp","3g2",
          "mxf","roq","nsv","f4v","f4p","f4a","f4b","mp3",
          "flac","ts"
        ],
        "MIME_TYPES": true,
        "MIME_TYPES_LIST": [
          "video"
        ]
      },
      "TEAMDRIVE": false,
      "TEAMDRIVES": [],
      "POLL_INTERVAL": 120,
      "SHOW_CACHE_LOGS": false
    },
    ```

4. Google Drive paths (e.g. `"My Drive/Media/Movies/"`) go under `SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS` and should look like this:

    _Note: This is usually set pre-filled by default._

      ```json
      "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
        "/data/Movies/": [
          "/movies/",
          "/mnt/unionfs/Media/Movies/",
          "My Drive/Media/Movies/"
        ],
        "/data/TV/": [
          "/tv/",
          "/mnt/unionfs/Media/TV/",
          "My Drive/Media/TV/"
        ],
        "/data/Music/": [
          "/music/",
          "/mnt/unionfs/Media/Music/",
          "My Drive/Media/Music/"
        ]
      },
      ```

      Note: If you are using [[Scenario 2 Custom Library Setup|Customizing Plex Libraries#scenario-2]], you will need to tweak this section of the config.

5. Save and Exit.

6. Next, you will need to authorize Google Drive. To do so, run the following command:

    ```shell
    plex_autoscan authorize
    ```

    If this doesn't work for you, update saltbox and rerun the plex_autoscan role:

    ```shell
    sb update
    sb install plex-autoscan
    ```

7. Visit the link shown to get the authorization code and paste that in and hit `enter`.

    ```text
    Visit https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=&access_type=offline and authorize against the account you wish to use
    Enter authorization code:
    ```

8. When access token retrieval is successful, you'll see this:

    ```text
    2018-06-24 05:57:58,252 -     INFO -    GDRIVE [140007964366656]: Requesting access token for auth code '4/AAAfPHmX9H_kMkMasfdsdfE4r8ImXI_BddbLF-eoCOPsdfasdfHBBzffKto'
    2018-06-24 05:57:58,509 -     INFO -    GDRIVE [140007964366656]: Retrieved first access token!
    2018-06-24 05:57:58,511 -     INFO -  AUTOSCAN [140007964366656]: Access tokens were successfully retrieved!
    ```

    _Note: Ignore any `Segmentation fault` messages._

9. Restart the service:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart plex_autoscan
    ```

10. Plex Autoscan will now start monitoring Google Drive.

## Make Plex scan a specific file or folder

## Web app

![](https://i.imgur.com/KTrbShI.png)

Setup instructions:

1. Enable `SERVER_ALLOW_MANUAL_SCAN` in your `/opt/plex_autoscan/config/config.json` file.

    ```json
    "SERVER_ALLOW_MANUAL_SCAN": true,
    ```

2. Visit your [Plex Autoscan URL](plex-autoscan-extras.md#obtaining-the-plex-autoscan-url) webpage.

3. Enter in the path to scan.

    _Note: The path can be in any form (e.g. `/data/Media/...`, `/mnt/unionfs/Media/...`, `My Drive/Media/....`). The 'Server Path Mappings' will redirect the scan to the correct location._

4. The request will now show up under Plex Autoscan logs.

## HTTP

1. Initiate a scan request via curl or equivalent tool:

    _Note: The path can be in any form (e.g. `/data/Media/...`, `/mnt/unionfs/Media/...`, `My Drive/Media/....`). The 'Server Path Mappings' will redirect the scan to the correct location._

    Format:

    ```shell
    curl -d "eventType=Manual&filepath=<PATH TO FILE/FOLDER>" <YOUR PLEX AUTOSCAN URL>
    ```

2. Examples:

    ```shell
    curl -d "eventType=Manual&filepath=/mnt/unionfs/Media/Movies/Shut In (2016)/Shut In (2016) - Bluray-1080p.x264.DTS-GECKOS.mkv" http://ipaddress:3468/0c1fa3c9867e48b1bb3aa055cb86`
    ```

    ```shell
    curl -d "eventType=Manual&filepath=/data/Movies/Shut In (2016)/Shut In (2016) - Bluray-1080p.x264.DTS-GECKOS.mkv" http://ipaddress:3468/0c1fa3c9867e48b1bb3aa055cb86`
    ```

3. The request will now show up under Plex Autoscan logs.

For more details on both options, see [[here|<https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan#misc>]].

## CLI

_Note 1: This is only done on the box where Plex is installed._

_Note 2: The path used here has to be exactly what Plex uses for its library._

_Note 3: This method does not use Plex Autoscan, and therefore, Plex will immediately start scanning the given paths._

### Command

_Note: Replace `<section ID>` ([[Plex Library Section IDs]]) and `<plex library's movie/tv show path>` with yours._

```shell
docker exec -u plex -i plex bash -c 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib;/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\ Media\ Scanner --scan --refresh --section <section ID> --directory '"'"'<movie or tv show path>'"'"''
```

### Examples

Movie (Section ID 1)

```shell
docker exec -u plex -i plex bash -c 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib;/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\ Media\ Scanner --scan --refresh --section 1 --directory '"'"'/data/Movies/The Predator (2018)/'"'"''
```

TV Show (Section ID 2)

```shell
docker exec -u plex -i plex bash -c 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib;/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\ Media\ Scanner --scan --refresh --section 2 --directory '"'"'/data/TV/The Walking Dead/'"'"''
```

TV Show with specific season scanned (Section ID 2)

```shell
docker exec -u plex -i plex bash -c 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib;/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\ Media\ Scanner --scan --refresh --section 2 --directory '"'"'/data/TV/Marvels Daredevil/Season 03/'"'"''
```
