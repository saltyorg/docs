# Install

If you're migrating from Cloudbox you probably want the [Cloudbox migration instructions](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/guides/cloudbox/)

If you're migrating from PlexGuide there are some rudimentary notes provided by a user [here](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/guides/plexguide/).  Expansions to those notes would be welcome.

Please read through these steps prior to executing any of them, just to get a grounding in what is going to happen through out the process.  It could be that things in later steps inform your decisions in earlier steps.

Broadly, the base install consists of six steps:

1. Installing [dependencies](#step-1-dependencies)
2. Preparing your [configuration file(s)](#step-2-configuration)
3. Running a [pre-install script](#step-3-preinstall)
4. Configuring your [cloud storage](#step-4-rclone)
5. Running the [install script](#step-5-saltbox)
6. Configuring installed [applications](#step-6-app-setup)

!!! warning
    There is no "uninstall" available.  To uninstall Saltbox entirely, you will need to wipe the machine and reinstall the OS.  You can remove all the containers, services, data, and the like, but things that are installed in the OS, for example rclone, are not tracked in a way that would allow uninstalling them.

## Step 1: Dependencies

!!! info
    This is assuming you are logged into your freshly installed remote server as `root`.

=== "curl"

    ```shell
    curl -sL https://install.saltbox.dev | sudo -H bash && cd /srv/git/saltbox

    ```

=== "wget"

    ```shell
    wget -qO- https://install.saltbox.dev | sudo -H bash && cd /srv/git/saltbox

    ```

=== "curl (verbose)"

    ```shell
    curl -sL https://install.saltbox.dev | sudo -H bash -s -- -v && cd /srv/git/saltbox

    ```

=== "wget (verbose)"

    ```shell
    wget -qO- https://install.saltbox.dev | sudo -H bash -s -- -v && cd /srv/git/saltbox

    ```

!!! info
    See [here](../../reference/dependencies.md) for more information about the dependencies.

## Step 2: Configuration

Make sure you fill out the following configuration files before proceeding. Each file will be located in `/srv/git/saltbox`

`accounts.yml`

To edit [assuming you are still logged in as `root`]:

    nano /srv/git/saltbox/accounts.yml

Contents:

``` { .yaml .annotate }
---
user:
  name: seed # (1)!
  pass: password123 # (2)!
  domain: testsaltbox.ml # (3)!
  email: your@email.com # (4)!
  ssh_key: # (13)!
cloudflare:
  email: # (5)!
  api: # (6)!
plex:
  user: # (7)!
  pass: # (8)!
  tfa: no # (9)!
dockerhub:
  user: # (10)!
  token: # (11)!
apprise: # (12)!
```

1. Username that will be created (if it doesn't exist) during the installation and apps that have automatic user configuration.

    Do not use root.

    Required.

2. Password used for username account during the installation and apps that have automatic user configuration.

    See the [password considerations.](../../reference/accounts.md#password-considerations)

    Required.

3. Domain that you want to use for the server.

4. Email address used for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

    Required.

5. Email used for the Cloudflare account.

6. Cloudflare Global API Key.

7. Plex.tv username or email address on the account.

8. Plex.tv password for the account.

9. Enable if you want to use the Two Factor Authentication [TFA] compatible Plex account login.

10. Docker Hub account name. Entering these credentials will at least double your image pull capacity from 100 every 6 hours to 200. <https://www.docker.com/blog/checking-your-current-docker-pull-rate-limits-and-status/>

11. Docker Hub account token

12. apprise url. See <https://github.com/caronc/apprise#popular-notification-services> for more information.

    ```yaml

    apprise: discord://webhook_id/webhook_token

    ```

13. SSH Public Key. The key will be added to your configured user's `authorized_keys` file. This parameter accepts either the public key or a GitHub url (i.e. [https://github.com/charlie.keys](https://github.com/charlie.keys)) which will pull the keys you have added to your GitHub account.

`settings.yml`

To edit [assuming you are still logged in as `root`]:

```shell
nano /srv/git/saltbox/settings.yml
```

Contents:

``` { .yaml .annotate }
---
downloads: /mnt/unionfs/downloads # (1)!!
rclone:
  version: latest # (3)!
  remote: google # (4)!
shell: bash # (5)!
authelia:
  master: yes # (6)!
  subdomain: login # (7)!
```

1. Folder used for docker /downloads volume. Does not affect mergerfs (/mnt/unionfs).

2. Folder used for temporary transcode files.

3. Rclone version that Saltbox will install.

    Valid options are **latest**, **beta** or a specific version (**1.55**).

4. Name of the rclone remote that Saltbox will mount by default and use in any automated configuration.

    Optional - Leave empty to avoid remote mount setup.

5. Shell used by the system. Valid options are bash or zsh.

6. If the current server should have Authelia installed or use one installed elsewhere. For a multi-server setup, review the [considerations](../basics/install_types.md#feederboxmediabox-setup-considerations) listed for your Authelia setup.

7. Subdomain used for Authelia.

    Use different values here when using a Mediabox + Feederbox setup if deploying multiple Authelia instances.

    On a Feederbox where you want to use Authelia on the Mediabox just put in the same subdomain the Mediabox uses for Authelia (master having been set to no on the Feederbox). Review the [considerations](../basics/install_types.md#feederboxmediabox-setup-considerations) listed for your Authelia setup.

!!! info
    See [here](../../reference/accounts.md) for more information about these settings.

## Step 3: Preinstall

!!! warning
    Make sure that you have set up the configuration correctly before proceeding.

This step will create the user account specified in `accounts.yml`, add it to sudoers, update the kernel, edit GRUB configuration, install Rclone, and reboot the server if needed.

```shell
sb install preinstall
```

!!! warning
    From this point you'll want to make sure you run commands as the user specified in the accounts.yml

If your server did not need to reboot you can run `su username` to switch user or reconnect to SSH as the newly created user. Everything after this point will assume you are running as the user entered in accounts.yml

!!! info
    See [here](../../reference/preinstall.md) for more information about the preinstall.

## Step 4: Rclone

!!! warning
    As noted in the previous step, from this point you'll want to make sure you are logged into the server as the user specified in the `accounts.yml`.

!!! info
    THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP, required only if you plan to use cloud storage [Google Drive, for instance]

    If you do not plan to use cloud storage, leave the `rclone -> remote:` setting blank in your `settings.yml`, and skip this step.

Saltbox defaults to an rclone remote pointed at your Google Drive named `google` [as shown in the settings.yml above].

There is nothing special about Saltbox's implementation of this setup, aside from its opinions about the media paths.

If you already know how to set that up, do so with your usual methods.  If not, here are five options.

Note that generally speaking these five options are mutually exclusive.

=== "Cloudbox Migration"
    You already have the required setup complete.  You should use your existing Google setup at least to start with.

    [Cloudbox migration instructions](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/guides/cloudbox/)

=== "PlexGuide/PTS Migration"
    You already have the required setup complete.  You should use your existing Google setup at least to start with.

    The issues you will have to deal with will largely be around:

    1. Encrypted drives
    2. File system differences
    3. Service account files [PlexGuide removed the `.json` extension from what it calls "BlitzKeys", Saltbox expects them to be there]

    [Plexguide migration notes](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/guides/plexguide/)

=== "Other Migration"
    You probably already have the required setup complete.  You should use your existing Google setup at least to start with.

    You will likely need to account for differences in the names of remotes.  Saltbox assumes that you have an rclone remote named `google` pointing to the root of your cloud storage, so you can either rename your existing remote or change the remote name in the settings.

    [Other migration notes](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/guides/other/)

=== "I'm totally new to this"
    IF YOU ARE MIGRATING FROM ANY OTHER RCLONE-BASED SETUP YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS.

    If you have a brand new Google Drive account and want to be walked through all the steps you need to perform, start [here](../../reference/rclone.md)

    That's an eight-step process that is mostly copy-paste commands.  When you have completed it, come back here.

    That eight-step process will create seven shared drives, 300 service accounts, and will configure rclone for you.

    This should be enough capacity for quite a while for most users.

=== "Minimal setup, please"

    The simplest possible case is:

    1. Set up a Google Project and OAuth Credential file if you don't already have one.
       This process is described [here](../../reference/google-project-setup.md)  You will need the ID and Secret from that process in step 3 below.
    2. Create a Shared Drive in the Google Web UI.
       This process is described [here](../../reference/guides/google-shared-drive.md)
    3. Create an rclone remote pointing at that shared drive.
       This process is described [here](../../reference/guides/rclone-remote.md)

!!! warning
    Do not proceed until you have configured your rclone remote[s] or disabled cloud storage in the settings.

## Step 5: Saltbox

If you are installing a [Feederbox/Mediabox setup](../basics/install_types.md) [if your reaction to this question is "huh?" then you are not, and should use the `saltbox` install], set up the Feederbox first, then add the [feeder mount](../../advanced/feeder.md) to the mediabox prior to install.

=== "Saltbox"
    ```shell
    sb install saltbox

    ```

=== "Mediabox"
    ```shell
    sb install mediabox

    ```

=== "Feederbox"
    ```shell
    sb install feederbox

    ```

=== "Core"
    ```shell
    sb install core

    ```

!!! info
    See [here](../../reference/install.md) for more information about the install.

## Reboot

After rebooting, you're now ready to go through the basic setup for the apps!

## Step 6: App Setup

If you would like to configure cloudplow to use service accounts to exceed the 750G daily upload limit, and you went through the scripted rclone setup above, you can do this now. Instructions are [here](https://docs.saltbox.dev/reference/cloudplow-config/).

Go through these one at a time in order; some of the setups depend on previous setups.

1. [NZBGet](../../apps/nzbget.md)
1. [ruTorrent](../../apps/rutorrent.md)
1. [NZBHydra2](../../apps/nzbhydra2.md)
1. [Jackett](../../apps/jackett.md)
1. [Plex Media Server](../../apps/plex.md)
1. [Autoscan](../../apps/autoscan.md)
1. [Sonarr](../../apps/sonarr.md)
1. [Radarr](../../apps/radarr.md)
1. [Lidarr](../../apps/lidarr.md)
1. [Tautulli](../../apps/tautulli.md)
1. [Overseerr](../../apps/overseerr.md)
1. [Portainer](../../apps/portainer.md)
1. [Organizr](../../apps/organizr.md)

!!! info
    These are not all the available applications, just the core set that are installed by the `saltbox` tag.  Click on the "Apps" header at the top for a full listing of applications available in Saltbox.  Click the "Sandbox" heading for a listing of commmunity-supplied applications.

Next, some tasks to perform [after installation is complete](after.md).
