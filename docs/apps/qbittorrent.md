# qBittorrent

## What is it?

[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" } is a bittorrent client programmed in C++ / Qt that uses libtorrent (sometimes called libtorrent-rasterbar) by Arvid Norberg.

It aims to be a good alternative to all other bittorrent clients out there. qBittorrent is fast, stable and provides unicode support as well as many features.

!!! Warning
      Make sure to choose a strong username/password combination because by default qBittorrent's Web API is completely exposed to the internet!<br>
      If someone guesses your qBit's credentials, they can, among other things, steal your tracker passkeys and delete torrents (data included).<br><br>
      If you don't need the Web API exposed, you can do so using the [inventory system](/saltbox/inventory/) with

``` { .yaml }
       qbittorrent_traefik_api_enabled: false
```

      and by rerunning the `qbittorrent` tag.

!!! Note
      if you're using private trackers be sure to go to `Options` -> `BittTorrent` and uncheck everything in Privacy section.
