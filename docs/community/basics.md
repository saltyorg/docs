# Basics

The Saltbox Community repository is installed with Saltbox as part of a standard install. The Saltbox Community application installers are provided and maintained by the community but subject to approval. The applications are not part of a standard Saltbox install, but they are tested and confirmed to be compatible with the Saltbox ecosystem.

Community Guides are written by the community to help others make the most of their system.
