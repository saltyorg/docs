# Google Group setup

This guide will show you how to set up a Google Group for use with service accounts.

It's assuming you're working through the steps from [here](rclone-manual.md) and have completed the following steps:

- verified [account drive permissions](google-account-perms.md)
- created the required [project](google-project-setup.md)

NOTE: This guide is assuming a Google Gsuite Business/Workspace account.

1. Open the Google Admin site: <https://admin.google.com/> and login with your Google account.  Click on the groups heading:
