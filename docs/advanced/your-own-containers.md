# Adding your own containers to Saltbox

When you install existing roles in saltbox, some things get handled behind the scenes for you.  Notably, this includes creating the subdomain[s] at cloudflare and creating the `/opt/APPNAME` directory tree.

When you add a container manually as outlined on this page, neither of those things will be done for you (unless you have installed our ddns container), so prior to running the docker commands described below you will have to create the `APPNAME.domain.tld` subdomain at cloudflare [or wherever your DNS is] and create the required `/opt/APPNAME` directory tree.

If you want to create a role file that you can install like the built-in applications, see [here](../sandbox/basics.md#contributing-to-sandbox-apps).

IMPORTANT: `APPNAME` is a placeholder.  *You need to change that* **everywhere it appears** to match the application you are installing.

## Creating and running the container

Once you have a docker-compose file as described above, you will use standard docker commands to create and run the container.

If the file is named `docker-compose.yml` and is located in the current working directory:

    docker compose up -d

If the file has some other name or is located elsewhere in the file system:

    docker compose up -d -d /path/to/something.yml

Remember to create the `APPNAME.domain.tld` subdomain at cloudflare [or wherever your DNS is] and create the required `/opt/APPNAME` directory tree prior to running that command.
