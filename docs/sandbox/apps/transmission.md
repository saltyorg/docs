### 1. Installation

``` shell

sb install sandbox-transmission

```

### 2. URL

- To access Transmission, visit `https://transmission._yourdomain.com_`

### 3. Setup

- Suggested desktop client is [Transmission Remote GUI](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui){: target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" }. It is to be set up with ssl enabled on port 443

- `/watch` is hard-coded in the software and not editable from the settings.json, see related issue. To get around this the folder is mounted to `/mnt/local/downloads/torrents/transmission{{ rolename }}/watch`

- Do not change the published ports if you want to be connectable.
