# Plex Utills

## What is it?

[Plex Utills](https://github.com/jkirkcaldy/plex-utills) is a set of scripts that enhance your plex library:

### 4K/HDR Posters

This script will go through your library and add a 4k banner to your posters. Configurable options include:

- Selecting full width banners or mini corner banners
- enabling HDR banners
- Backup your original posters alongside your media

This can be run on both your films library and your TV shows Library. If enabled on your TV shows, a mini 4K banner will be added to each of your 4K episodes, not the season posters. This is due to the possibility of having Shows/Seasons with mixed resolutions. TV shows will be done at the same time as film posters.

### 3D Posters

Much like the 4K poster script, this will go through your films and add a 3D banner to your films. Currently as Plex has no support for labelling content as 3D this will only work for 3D films kept in a separate library. You can configure the script to have full width banners or the mini corner banners as well as backing up your posters.
