# Creating an rclone remote for Google Drive

This article describes how to create an rclone remote for Google Drive

This article walks through creating a Google Drive remote, but basically the same process is followed for any type of remote; dropbox, sftp, whatever.  Choose the desired type of remote in step 4 and follow the prompts.

## Prerequisites

To go through this process, you will need the following:

   1. either one of these for your Google account:

      a. ClientID/Secret

      b. Service Account JSON file(s)

   2. The project associated with these needs to be set to "external".  See step 9 on [this page](../google-project-setup.md).
   3. rclone installed on your saltbox machine [which means the preinstall has been run]
   4. rclone [same or higher version as on the saltbox machine] and a web browser installed on a machine local to you [this machine needs a GUI].  NOTE: this should be the same machine on which you are sshed to the saltbox server, as you will have to copy-paste a very long token a bit later.


## Walkthrough

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    rclone config
    ```

2. Type `n` for "New remote" and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.

    ```shell
    $ rclone config
    2022/02/26 15:29:40 NOTICE: Config file "/Users/geezer/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" not found - using defaults
    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    ```

3. For "name", type in the name of your choice and and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>. [This name is arbitrary, aside from rclone's limitations on name; we're using `google` in this example]

    ```shell
    n/s/q> n
    name> google
    ```

4. For "Type of storage", type in `drive`, or the corresponding number, and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.  Note that this list is constantly changing, will be much longer, and the numbers won't match what's shown here.  **Read what's on the screen.**

    ```shell
    Option Storage.
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
    1 / 1Fichier
      \ "fichier"
     ...
    15 / Google Cloud Storage (this is not Google Drive)
       \ "google cloud storage"
    16 / Google Drive
       \ "drive"
    17 / Google Photos
       \ "google photos"
    ...
    45 / seafile
       \ "seafile"
    Storage> drive
    ```

5. Client ID and Secret:

    === "Using a Client ID and secret to connect"

        Enter the Client ID and Client Secret when prompted

        ```shell
        Storage> drive
        Option client_id.
        Google Application Client Id
        Setting your own is recommended.
        See `https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id` for how to create your own.
        If you leave this blank, it will use an internal key which is low performance.
        Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
        client_id> JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE
        Option client_secret.
        OAuth Client Secret.
        Leave blank normally.
        Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
        client_secret> OZZYTONYGEEZERBILL
        ```

    === "Using a service account to connect"

        Leave the Client ID and Client Secret blank when prompted

        ```shell
        Storage> drive
        Option client_id.
        Google Application Client Id
        Setting your own is recommended.
        See https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id for how to create your own.
        If you leave this blank, it will use an internal key which is low performance.

        client_secret>
        ```

6. For the "Scope that rclone should use when requesting access from drive", type in `drive`, or the corresponding number (i.e. `1`), to select "Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder", and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.

    ```shell
    Option scope.
    Scope that rclone should use when requesting access from drive.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
     1 / Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder.
       \ "drive"
     2 / Read-only access to file metadata and file contents.
       \ "drive.readonly"
       / Access to files created by rclone only.
     3 | These are visible in the drive website.
       | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.
       \ "drive.file"
       / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
     4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
       \ "drive.appfolder"
       / Allows read-only access to file metadata but

    ```

7. For "ID of the root folder", leave blank and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.

    ```shell
    Option root_folder_id.
    ID of the root folder.
    Leave blank normally.
    Fill in to access "Computers" folders (see docs), or for rclone to use
    a non root folder as its starting point.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    root_folder_id>
    ```

8. For "Service Account Credentials JSON file path":

    === "Using a Client ID and secret to connect"

        leave blank and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>

    ```

11. In the next section, follow the instructions on your local machine.

    ```shell
    Option config_token.
    For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
    a web browser available.
    For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/
    Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
    version recommended):
     rclone authorize "drive" "eyJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiI2OTUxMzMzNjg1ODMtcmU5MmE3Y3F0cGdqc2JvOGlscGwxamIzN2draXRibmwuYXBwcy5nb29nbGV1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20iLCJjbGllbnRfc2VjcmV0IjoiOVRCQ2p2WHBlNlhxaFlPUG5JUGpRTkdIIiwic2NvcGUiOiJkcml2ZSJ9"
    Then paste the result.
    Enter a value.
    config_token>
    ```

12. If asked to login, use the Google Drive account you want to store your data in.

    ![](../../images/rclone-remote/google-login.png)

13. Give access by clicking "Allow".

    ![](../../images/rclone-remote/google-permission.png)

14. The browser should report success.

    ![](../../images/rclone-remote/dropbox-success.png)

15. And a token should show up in the terminal on your local computer:

    ```text
    2022/05/09 22:56:09 NOTICE: Log in and authorize rclone for access
    2022/05/09 22:56:09 NOTICE: Waiting for code...
    2022/05/09 22:56:16 NOTICE: Got code
    Paste the following into your remote machine --->
    ROGERPETEJOHNKEITH
    <---End paste
    ```

16. Paste the token at the rclone prompt and press Enter.

    ```text
    Enter a value.
    config_token>  ROGERPETEJOHNKEITH
    ```

17. For "Configure this as a team drive?":

        ```
        You'll be presented with a list of shared drives you have access to.  Enter a number and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.

        ```shell
        Option config_team_drive.
        Shared Drive
        Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("0AF3NBtE4KF_iUk9PVA").
        Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value.

        ```

18. Confirm that the remote details look OK, type `y` and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.

    ```shell
    --------------------
    [google]
    type = drive
    client_id = JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE
    client_secret = OZZYTONYGEEZERBILL
    scope = drive
    token = {"access_token":"...","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"...","expiry":"2022-02-26T17:56:24.53802-06:00"}
    team_drive = BINGBANGBOING
    root_folder_id =
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y
    ```

19. To exit, type `q` and press <kbd class="platform-all">Enter</kbd>.

    ```shell
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====
    google               drive

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
    ```

The name of this remote [`google` in this case] is what you should enter in the rclone settings as you proceed with the install.

If you wish to encrypt this remote, proceed with [creating a crypt remote](rclone-remote-encrypted.md)
