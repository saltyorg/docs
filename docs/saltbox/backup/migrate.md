# Migration

This guide will outline some basic steps to copy/move your Saltbox setup to another server and/or another domain name.

If you are looking to migrate your existing setup *to* Saltbox, there are guides for [Cloudbox](../../reference/guides/cloudbox.md), or [arbitrary](../../reference/guides/other.md) setups.

This page discusses migrating an existing Saltbox setup.

Listed below are some common scenarios and their migration instructions.

## Move Saltbox to Another Server and Keep the Same Domain Name

### Current Server

1. [Back up](backup.md) your current Saltbox server.

### New Server

1. [Restore](restore.md) Saltbox to the new server.

2. If you are not using Cloudflare:

    - Point your domain's [DNS](../prerequisites/prerequisites.md#domain) to the new server.

3. Install the relevant Saltbox type: [Saltbox, Mediabox, or Feederbox](../install/install.md#step-5-saltbox).

4. Install any extra, not-default containers you had installed previously from [Sandbox](../../sandbox/index.md) or on your own.

5. IF YOU ARE USING PLEX-AUTOSCAN, which you may not be depending on how recent your install is [autoscan has replaced it as the default], check to see if your [Plex Autoscan URL](../../apps/plex-autoscan.md#obtaining-the-plex-autoscan-url) has changed and update [Sonarr](../../apps/sonarr.md), [Radarr](../../apps/radarr.md), and [Lidarr](../../apps/lidarr.md) accordingly.

## Move Saltbox to Another Server and Change the Domain Name

### Current Server

1. [Back up](backup.md) your current Saltbox server.

### New Server

1. [Restore](restore.md) Saltbox to the new server.

2. Add your new domain name into [Accounts](../install/install.md#configuration).

3. If you are using Cloudflare:

    1. Register your domain with [Cloudflare](../../faq/Cloudflare.md).

    2. Add the Cloudflare API into [Accounts](../install/install.md#step-2-configuration).

4. If you are not using Cloudflare:

    - Point your domain's [DNS](../prerequisites/prerequisites.md#domain) to the new server.

5. Replace the domain name in app specific config files:

    - `/opt/cloudplow/config.json`

    - `/opt/motd/config.json`

    - `/opt/traktarr/config.json` (only if installed)

    - `/opt/plex_dupefinder/config.json` (only if installed)

    - `/opt/plex_patrol/settings.ini` (only if installed)

6. Install the relevant Saltbox type: [Saltbox, Mediabox, or Feederbox](../install/install.md#step-5-saltbox).

7. Run `sb install authelia-reset` to set authelia up for the new domain.

8. Install any extra, not-default containers you had installed previously from [Sandbox](../../sandbox/index.md) or on your own.

9. IF YOU ARE USING PLEX-AUTOSCAN, which you may not be depending on how recent your install is [autoscan has replaced it as the default], check to see if your [Plex Autoscan URL](../../apps/plex-autoscan.md#obtaining-the-plex-autoscan-url) has changed and update [Sonarr](../../apps/sonarr.md), [Radarr](../../apps/radarr.md), and [Lidarr](../../apps/lidarr.md) accordingly.

## Keep Saltbox on the Same Server but Change the Domain Name

1. [Back up](backup.md) your current Saltbox server.

2. Add your new domain name into [Accounts](../install/install.md#step-2-configuration).

3. If you are using Cloudflare:

    1. Register your domain with [Cloudflare](../../faq/Cloudflare.md).

    2. Add the Cloudflare API into [Accounts](../install/install.md#step-2-configuration).
