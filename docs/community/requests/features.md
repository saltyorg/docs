# Features

We welcome suggestions for genuine enhancements to the Saltbox ecosystem. Please submit requests that add real value, not workarounds for issues already addressed or support questions.

## Guidelines

- Ensure your request is a genuine enhancement, not a workaround for a problem.
- If your idea is actually a solution to a support issue, please use our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ugfKXpFND8) for support instead.
- Check other requests to avoid duplicates.
- Be specific about the problem your feature solves.
- Suggest possible implementation details if you have them.

## Sandbox

You can suggest new apps for inclusion in our repositories by opening a request.

Be aware that developers are volunteers, and those who contribute new roles are generally expected to help maintain them. As a result, they likely won't explore unfamiliar apps just to fulfill a request, and the requester is often best suited to take on the role.

App requests also help gauge community interest—roles with more support or "votes" are more likely to be picked up by contributors. If a request receives no activity, it will become stale and end up closed automatically, so showing your support by commenting or reacting can help keep it active.
